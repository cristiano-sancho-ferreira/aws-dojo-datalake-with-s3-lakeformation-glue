## Create Data Lake with Amazon S3, Lake Formation and Glue using Terraform

Ready to build a data lake - well a small one. In this workshop, you will keep two data sets sales and customers in Amazon S3. AWS Glue is used to catalog the data. You then use AWS Lake Formation to provide specific permission for the salesuser and customersuser users for the sales and customers tables. The users will use Amazon Athena to query the data as per the permission defined.
